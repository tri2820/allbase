## An infinitely extensible team platform

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to AllBase, a modern WorkOS that can be extended with third-party appsâ€”just like VS Code!

Say goodbye to app overload and hello to a seamless, integrated experience.

## Why AllBase?

Teams often struggle with **SaaS waste** and **data silos**, making it difficult to stay organized and efficient. AllBase centralizes all your essential applications in one place, increasing productivity and reducing headaches.

## Features

### For Teams:

- All Your Apps in One Place
- Real-Time Collaboration
- Adaptable to Any Workflow

### For Developers:

- **Built with Familiar Technology**: Vanilla JS, React, Vite, and more. We focus on providing a great developer experience. For more information, see [Build Your First App](./docs/BUILD_YOUR_FIRST_APP.md).
- **Pre-Made Modules**: Think authentication, real-time features, data management, and caching.
- **Build Internal Tools Easily**: Have an itch? Learn to create your own solutions in just one day.
- **Marketplace**: Launch and validate your apps where your users are.

## Performance

Third-party apps are **secured** and **lightning fast**. Each app runs in an isolated sandbox with limited access to the DOM and Web APIs. They are given the same level of performance and accessibility as AllBase itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> AllBase is still a work in progress. The security layer is implemented but has not safeguarded all Web APIs.

## Proudly Open Source

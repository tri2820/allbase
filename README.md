## Why AllBase?

AllBase fits any workflow, making it easy for teams to stay organized. It brings all your important apps together in one place, helping you work better and faster.

No more wasting money on unnecessary software or dealing with data silos!

## Features

### For Teams:

- All Your Apps in One Place
- Real-Time Collaboration
- Adaptable to Any Workflow

### For Developers:

- **Built with Familiar Technology**: Vanilla JS, React, Vite, and more. We focus on providing a great developer experience. For more information, see [Build Your First App](./docs/BUILD_YOUR_FIRST_APP.md).
- **Pre-Made Modules**: Think authentication, real-time features, data management, and caching.
- **Create Internal Tools Easily**: Have an itch? Learn to create your own solutions in just 30 minutes.

## Performance

Third-party apps are **secured** and **lightning fast**. Each app runs in an isolated sandbox with limited access to the DOM and Web APIs. They are given the same level of performance and accessibility as AllBase itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> AllBase is still a work in progress. The security layer is implemented but has not safeguarded all Web APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Development**:

   ```sh
   bun i # or npm i

   ```

2. **Production**:

   ```sh
   bun run build
   # your app is ready to serve in the output folder
   ```
